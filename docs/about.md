I do ops-y stuff for [PhotoBox](https://www.photobox.co.uk/). In previous lives I did [sound engineering](http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live), [played the drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4YxoI3gVE) and made [unpleasant electronic noises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEZgbvNbag). I lived in London for thirty years before moving to the lovely city of Hamburg in 2013. I liked brutalism before it became hip again, but only just. Unreasonably fond of dogs. Views are my own, particularly the grumpy ones.
